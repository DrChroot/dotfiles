personal config files and copies of others in case those are removed

## BSD
I've recently taken an interest in the *BSDs. In fact, I completely wiped my X230 hdd that had Win10 and several Linux distros on it, and replaced it all withan encrypted ZFS FreeBSD install. I have an OpenBSD VPS with [Vultr](https://vultr.com) ($2.50/mo.) and NetBSD/DragonflyBSD running in VMs on FBSD.

All that to say, I've tried to amalgamate my bsd configs here, as well as my old Linux configs in case I decided to return to Debian/Slackware.

###### Organization
Most everything related to my window manager and xorg (such as xcolors, statbar, and even weechat configs) have been placed in the "xorg" directory.
